## Features

- **Platformer Gameplay**: Control a character that must avoid obstacles for 30 seconds
- **Physics System**: Implemented gravity and jumping mechanics
- **Collision Detection**: Real-time collision detection between player and obstacles
- **Game State Management**: Menu, gameplay, and game over states
- **Obstacle Generation**: Random obstacle spawning system

## Technologies

- **C++17** - Core programming language
- **SFML 2.6** - Graphics and window management
- **CMake** - Build system

Key Classes

Application: Manages the main game loop, event processing, and rendering
Game: Contains game logic, obstacle management, and collision detection
Player: Implements character physics, jumping, and gravity
Obstacle: Represents obstacles in the game world
Vector2D: Utility structure for 2D math operations
